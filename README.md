# -WeRateDogs.-
Introduction
Real-world data rarely comes clean. The dataset that you will be wrangling (and analyzing and visualizing) is the
tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_ rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that
rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.
After I finished the wrangling process, the analysis begins by creating a master data frame that contains all the
data frames in our master data frame to answer the below questions and to get more information about the
types of dogs and names people most like.

Finding 
- Most of people using twitter by their iPhone
- Most of the people prefer pupper dog type
- Most of people as we see prefer charile name

Finalley 
 Most of the users like pupper and also most of them retweet their tweets, so is the favorite
types of dog for all the people.
